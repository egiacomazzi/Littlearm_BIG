#### Problems I have had: ####
* one servo did not work at the beginning -> opend it and put it back together -> servo moved
* had to file the *elbow* to let the servo move without resistance
insert picture here: ![file here](/path/img.jpg "elbow")
* one of the servo gripper fingers broke
* the wrist yoke broke and I had to glue it with the strogest glue the IT had (wait 24h)
* power supply cable stopped to work -> replaced it
